# ascii-knight-crawler
An RPG-style simulation-themed Rust class project.

## Early Vision
A procedural dungeon crawler using text. I'll be using RPG elements to drive design choices and keep the application visually simple. 

- Character stats
- Item(s) and associated benefits
- Random enemies
- Random environments
- Health statuses
- etc ..

# Final Submission
For my final submission, I implemented Bart's suggestion to have the character fully autonomous. 

## AI Notice
I used Claude Haiku for debugging assistance, and for driving a deeper understanding of nuanced Rust concepts like lifetimes, enums, and mutable refs. Code, logic, and design are my own.
