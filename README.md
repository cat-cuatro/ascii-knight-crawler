# ascii-knight-crawler
An RPG-style simulation-themed Rust class project.

## Early Vision
A procedural dungeon crawler using text. I'll be using RPG elements to drive design choices and keep the application visually simple. 

- Character stats
- Item(s) and associated benefits
- Random enemies
- Random environments
- Health statuses
- etc ..
